# Semantic Invariants (Constitution of the Project)

These statements define the **non-negotiable meaning** of this project.
They cannot be changed by AI agents.  
Only the human author may modify this file.

---

## Core Principles

- All meaning originates from the human author.
- AI agents execute transformations but do not invent claims.
- Block files represent atomic, reusable statements of meaning.
- Chat archives are raw evidence, not truth.
- Invariants override blocks when conflicts appear.
- Blocks override chapters when conflicts appear.
- Chapters are build artifacts, not sources of meaning.
- Candidates may never be used in assembly.

---

## Architectural Invariants

- Pipeline must never generate new claims.
- Assembler only composes; Extractor only extracts; Organizer only restructures.
- Critic evaluates consistency but never rewrites content.
- Knowledge base remains read-only to all but Extractor/Organizer.
- No agent may write outside allowed output paths.
- Meaning drift is considered an error condition.

---

## Safety Invariants

- No private or sensitive data may enter the block layer.
- Chat archives remain external and read-only.
- Each block must have boundaries and a confidence level.
